# Coinmarketcap crypto parser
SBER school21 




Firstly install these libs :
- requests
- bs4
- selenium
- pandas
- json 

To use the parser, download 4 files: "_init_.py", "data.py", "download.py" and "parse.py". 
Then run "_init_.py" - and wait for the results.

You can experiment with another URL of coinmarketcap quotes. 
For example, from the DeFi or NFT pages https://coinmarketcap.com/view/defi/ or https://coinmarketcap.com/view/collectibles-nfts/. 
This will work, since the table shows the same class names in html for all sections of the site.

In crypto.json and crypto.csv you can see the results of the program execution.
